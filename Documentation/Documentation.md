# **BPM Analysis documentation**

# Design theory
The goal is to take PCG data recorded via consumer household equipment and convert it into usable data. to plot changes in heart rate, beats per minute (bpm) over time. Normally, clinical PCG data is captured via advanced and expensive equipment that may not be easily accessible to the general public such as digital stethoscopes etc. My goal is to extract information by using a algorithm to compensate for inadequate hardware. 

The script will track bpm over time like a heart rate monitor, but using a recording of a patient's heartbeat instead. The resulting plot should accurately reflect fast changes in heart rate.

I don't like the idea of using a `start_bpm_hint` as a user input since it makes batch processing impossible. I want the algorithm to be automatic and independent. 
In a ideal world, the user should only need to enter a file, press run, and get the data out. All other logic should be handled by the script

# General knowledge:
## Phonocardiography (PCG)
**Phonocardiography (PCG)** is a non-invasive technique that records and analyzes heart sounds and murmurs. It uses a sensitive microphone (phonocardiograph) placed on the chest wall to convert acoustic vibrations into electronic signals, which are then displayed as a waveform (phonocardiogram).
**Key points:**
- **Purpose**: Provides a visual representation of heart sounds (S1, S2, S3, S4) and any pathological murmurs, allowing detailed timing and frequency analysis.
- **Advantage**: Unlike auscultation with a stethoscope, PCG creates a permanent, objective record that can be replayed, measured, and compared over time.
- **Applications**: Diagnosing valvular diseases (e.g., stenosis, regurgitation), congenital heart defects, and cardiac arrhythmias; also used in research and teaching.
- **Modern use**: Often integrated with digital systems and can be combined with ECG for precise correlation with the cardiac cycle.

**Audio depends on positioning of the heart relative to the recording device:** 
This is relevant when the patient moves their body, rotates their chest, Inhales or exhales. 
As the diaphragm descends, the heart itself shifts slightly in the chest cavity. It can rotate or move downwards, changing its orientation relative to the fixed position of the stethoscope. 
For example, the heart's rotation might simultaneously move the pulmonic valve closer or into a better acoustic alignment with the stethoscope resulting in a S1 being louder or quieter throughout the recording.

Springer's pipeline was not made to process PCG information at different/changing heart rates. It expects the bpm to be constant across time.
- **Springer:** Calculates **one global HR estimate per recording** before segmentation begins. It uses this single value to parameterize the Gaussian duration distributions (S1, Systole, S2, Diastole) for the **entire sequence**.

### What is a Wavelet Transform?
In order to do time series analysis, we must understand these fundamental concepts:
What are [wavelets](https://youtu.be/jnxqHcObNK4)? 
what is wavelet [convolution](https://youtu.be/jnxqHcObNK4?t=1282)?
We need to find the contribution of a certain frequency around a timepoint. 
By applying wavelet transform, to generate a wavelet scalogram, we can [view a sound's structure](https://youtu.be/jnxqHcObNK4?t=1813)

Side note: [Mike X Cohen](https://youtu.be/ljw3gW-nL0E?t=1721) is fkin intelligent:
We should maintain a holistic view. [If you have a real finding in your data, it will be robust to a reasonable range of parameters](https://youtu.be/ljw3gW-nL0E?t=1676)
aka a good algorithm should have a large range of configuration values that will work on any input data. aka, if you find yourself tuning config/parameters often, your algorithm is not robust. 
This is why it's a good idea to use wavelet convolution for time series analysis

### Hilbert transform
What is [Hilbert transform](https://youtu.be/NMR7PR7M4Iw)?
[What is a Hilbert Space?](https://youtu.be/FFPXm-tuOt8?t=153)

The Hilbert transform can give you a clean separation between envelope and oscillation. This can only be done if the signal has slow changes riding on fast oscillations.
If you have a signal where something is changing slowly while something else is wiggling quickly, and these two aspects don't overlap in their frequency content, then the Hilbert transform can pull them apart accurately.

This is applicable to our application because we don't care about the raw waveform, only the larger underlying envelope. As you can see, the the "carrier", fast oscillation within the envelope, are visible

We can identify the following parameters for S1/S2 sounds
- Spectral centroid trajectory
- Bandwidth evolution
- Dominant frequency
- Energy envelope shape (attack/decay)

- [x] Implemented
S1 tends to have more energy in the lower frequency band, S2 in the higher frequency band.
We calculate the ratio between  these energies and adjust pairing confidence accordingly. If the first peak is more S1-like and the second more S2-like, boost confidence; if the pattern is reversed, penalize.

We use a Gaussian‑weighted sum of the band energy to get the "energy of the whole beat". 100ms is average duration of the S1 heart sound, the width of the beat's Hilbert envelope. We make the gaussian this width and place it at the detected peak. Then use it to mask out the section of time we are interested in. 








### I still need to research:
- [mel-spectrogram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=280s)
- Wavelet Scalogram



I want to generate a profile over time:
so we average the features of the past 5 labeled S1 peaks and build a understanding of what S1 should look like in the context of this recording. 

what if we further this idea by sampling at random indices, we take 10 random marked S1 peaks after labeling is done and re-run the labeling using this "trained model"
like we are training a model in real time to label, then label to train the model, recursively. 

for the features, I want to sample the entire beat, not just the time at the peak. this means finding the bounds of the envelope and sampling the data within that time frame maybe with increasing significance towards the center?
like we use a gaussian to mask the... or maybe not, do the edges of the beat contain important data? if not we should mask it out... but what if it does?







# Explanation of PCG Preprocessing
## Generating our audio envelope:
### How was the Audio Envelope calculated?
Previously, the Audio Envelope is abs(filtered audio) then a centered 100ms rolling mean at 500 Hz. Peak detection currently returns the top of that envelope
#### Trapezoidal waveforms causes the middle of the sound to not be the peak amplitude
I've noticed from the peak detection algorithm, It places the peak at the highest point, but sometimes the audio envelope of a wave might look like a cut mountain and sometimes slanted. we basically need to capture the middle of the peak of a trapezoidal wave. 
[![|508x155](https://i.imgur.com/xkhzAQS.png)]
From this example, we can see how the placement of the detected peak is not center with the mass of the waveform resulting in a very small inaccuracy.

![|398x161](Y1rGxdpPAq4.png)

**Why this is a issue:**
HRV is calculated from R-R intervals. Since HRV is so sensitive (standard deviation of ~10-50ms) we cannot afford any noise in the HRV calculation. The HRV function expects accurate data so if we feed it incorrect peak timings the the HRV calculated will be wrong. 

> [!think]
> Maybe we can solve this in a simple way:
> we just take the integral of the waveform between two troughs and place the peak such that it divides the area under the curve in half. This should result in a slightly more accurate placement of the labels.
### Hilbert Envelope:
[![|1645|1027x175](https://imgur.com/69ibaD7.jpg)

#### Issues with the Hilbert Envelope
- Linear dynamic range results in loss of weak S2 amplitudes at high BPM. "At 200 bpm, S1 is very loud and prominent... S2 becomes very soft or even inaudible"
- heart sounds are transient, not sinusoidal
- Hilbert envelope might show artificial peaks between S1 and S2 due to Spectral overlap (S1 tail and S2 onset interfere)




### Homomorphic envelope
Homomorphic filtering is a nonlinear signal processing technique that separates multiplicative components in a signal by transforming them into additive components via logarithms. For phonocardiography, this is powerful because heart sounds are approximately the product of:
- Slowly varying amplitude modulation (the envelope)
- Rapid oscillations (the "carrier" valve vibration frequencies)

Homomorphic filtering explicitly separates the envelope from the carrier. 

> [!think]
> Perhaps we can use **Hilbert** for timing precision and **homomorphic** for amplitude comparison.

After implementing Homomorphic envelope, it doesn't really make a improvement... I think I'll just use Hilbert

> obviously my starting bpm suggestion should be value for the long term bpm.
> 
the long term bpm should change slowly and within physiological limits. limited by the `max_bpm` the slope 
I input 90bpm as the start, then the `Long-Term BPM` goes from 90 to 176bpm in 18seconds (86bpm/18s)
since everything is based on the `Long-Term BPM`, we need to make sure it's accurate but not reactive.

> [!think] here's my interpretation of the issue
> - **Hinted 90 BPM**: The `s1_s2_max_interval_sec` is set to approximately 0.33 seconds. The logic assumes any two peaks closer than this are an S1-S2 pair within a _single_ heartbeat.
> - **Actual 170 BPM**: The true interval between _separate_ heartbeats is 60/170≈0.35 seconds.
> - **Actual 181 BPM**: The true interval between _separate_ heartbeats is 60/181≈0.33 seconds.
> 
> when the actual interval between two distinct heartbeats ($0.35$s or $0.33$s) becomes equal to or shorter than the set `s1_s2_max_interval_sec` (0.33s), the algorithm misinterprets them. It sees two separate heartbeats, but because their time difference falls within the "S1-S2" window, it incorrectly considers them as components of a single heartbeat and likely discards one of the peaks. This results in an undercounting of the actual heartbeats and an artificially lower BPM calculation.
> #### Proposed Solution:
> we can use this long term bpm to determine what the expected bpm should be. that way, if the script calculates a bpm that's completely off, it should correct itself.
> for example, If I input a suggested bpm of 120, then the script calculates the interval between beats to be at 240bpm. then we can obviously conclude that it counted a S2 as a lone S1, it missed the pairing. So we can also use this discrepancy to work with the normal deviation we calculated in the other step, to definitively conclude that the beat is supposed to be S2.
> obviously my starting bpm suggestion should be value for the long term bpm.

### Code Implementation:
This concept became the **`update_long_term_bpm()`** function and the **`state['long_term_bpm']`** variable in `bpm_analysis.py`. The key insight was that `s1_s2_max_interval_sec` should be calculated from a **stable, slowly-adapting BPM belief** rather than from the instantaneous interval between the last two beats.
The configuration parameter:
```python
"s1_s2_interval_rr_fraction": 0.7,  # The S1-S2 interval cannot be longer than this fraction of the R-R interval.
```

### Long-Term BPM vs Instantaneous BPM
**Problem:** A mislabeled beat could drastically shrink s1_s2_max_interval, causing all subsequent beats to be misclassified.
**Solution:** Maintain two BPM values:
- `long_term_bpm`: Slowly adapting belief (0.05 learning rate) that stabilizes the S1-S2 window
- `instant_bpm`: Raw calculation from last interval, used only to update the belief
**Why this works:** Allows the algorithm to self-correct. If instant BPM spikes to 240 but long-term is 120, we know we double-counted S2 and can trigger corrective logic.
**Code:** `update_long_term_bpm()`, `PeakClassifier.state['long_term_bpm']`

### Dynamic S1-S2 Pairing Window
**Problem:** At 90 BPM, true S1-S1 interval is 0.67s. But if s1_s2_max_interval is 0.33s, then at 170 BPM (true interval 0.35s), the algorithm merges separate beats.
**Solution:** `s1_s2_max_interval_sec = min(0.4, expected_rr_interval * 0.6)` where expected_rr comes from long_term_bpm, not last interval.
**Physiological basis:** S1-S2 interval is ~35-50% of total R-R interval and adapts with heart rate.


### We add a S1-S2 pairing penalty for the timing of the S1-S2 interval
If the current peak is S1, we take a look at the current heart rate and determine the distance S2 should be. If the next peak is too far or too close to the current peak, we apply a penalty to the pairing confidence. 
The pairing logic uses a V-shaped penalty based on how far the observed S1–S2 interval deviates from the expected interval. 

The center of this V is where we expect S2 to be, so no penalty. The further away we get from the expected interval, the higher the penalty we apply. There's a bit of leeway before the ramp starts applying the penalty. It's just a linear function right now. 

Also, if the timing deviates too much from expected, we hard reject the pairing and move onto Lone S1 decision. 
#### How is the expected interval calculated from BPM?
using the Weissler regression (ET vs HR slope of approximately -1.0 to -1.7 ms per bpm increase)
for example, At 135 bpm: 300 - (75 × 1.0) ≈ 225 ms

## As BPM increases, the S1-S2 prominence differential increases
> [!ask]
> At higher bpm, the loudness of S1 is much louder than S2. why is this?
> I'm looking at the waveform of a heartbeat recording and I can't see S2 at all. at 200 bpm, S1 Is very loud and prominent. 

**at extremely high heart rates (like 200 bpm), diastole shortens dramatically more than systole, leading to a much softer S2 and making S1 appear disproportionately loud.**
1. **Dramatic Shortening of Diastole:**
    - The cardiac cycle has two main phases: **Systole** (ventricular contraction/ejection) and **Diastole** (ventricular relaxation/filling).
    - As heart rate increases, both phases shorten, but diastole shortens proportionally much more than systole.
    - **At 200 bpm:**
        - Cycle length = 60 seconds / 200 beats = **0.3 seconds (300 ms) per beat.**
        - **Systole duration** is relatively fixed by contraction/ejection mechanics. Even at high rates, it might be ~150-200 ms.
        - **Diastole duration** = Cycle length - Systole duration = 300 ms - 150-200 ms ≈ 100-150 ms (or less). Diastole becomes extremely brief.
		Studies of maximal exercise show that systole can occupy 50-60% of the cycle at extreme rates. 
2. **Impact on S2 Loudness (Aortic & Pulmonary Valve Closure):**
    - S2 is produced by the closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) at the end of systole.
    - The loudness of S2 depends significantly on the pressure gradient across these valves at the moment of closure.
    - **Very Short Diastole = Reduced Ventricular Filling (Preload),** With diastole compressed to 100-150 ms, the ventricles have drastically less time to fill with blood before the next contraction.
    - **Reduced Filling = Reduced Stroke Volume,** The amount of blood ejected in the next systole (stroke volume) is much lower.
    - **Lower Stroke Volume = Lower Aortic/Pulmonary Pressure & Weaker Valve Closure:**
        - Less blood is ejected into the arteries.
        - Consequently, the pressure difference forcing the aortic and pulmonary valves shut at the end of systole is much smaller.
        - **Result:** The semilunar valves close much more gently and quietly. **S2 becomes very soft or even inaudible.**
		At 200 bpm, because the heart doesn't have time to fill (low preload), it pumps out very little blood (low stroke volume).
		And because the Stroke Volume is tiny, the system pressure generated is low. S2 is caused by the blood in the aorta snapping back against the valve. If there is less pressure pushing back, the "snap" is weak.
		Also the momentum of the blood, the pressure wave generated by the LV, probably becomes more continuous rather than a pulsing force. the discrete packets of blood excreted by the heart blend together into one continuous flow to some extent. 
3. **Impact on S1 Loudness (Mitral & Tricuspid Valve Closure):**
    - S1 is produced by the closure of the atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid) at the beginning of systole.
    - Its loudness depends on:
        - The **position and tautness of the valve leaflets** at the onset of ventricular contraction.
        - The **force and speed of ventricular contraction** slamming the valves shut.
        - The **pressure gradient** across the closed valves immediately after closure.
    - **High Heart Rate & Sympathetic Tone:** Tachycardia at 200 bpm is almost always driven by high sympathetic nervous system activity (stress, exercise, arrhythmia). This **increases myocardial contractility**.
    - **Forceful Contraction:** Despite reduced filling, the sympathetic drive makes the ventricular contraction **more forceful and rapid**.
    - **Result:** The AV valves are slammed shut vigorously by this forceful contraction. **S1 remains loud, or may even become louder** due to the increased contractility.
    *It's important to note:* 
	- The reduced preload (from ultra-short diastole) results in a lower amplitude sound which should offset the increase in amplitude caused by contractility, but my dataset shows a positive correlation with audio amplitude and BPM. 
4. **Proximity of S2 to the Next S1:**
    - With systole taking ~150-200 ms and the total cycle only 300 ms, S2 occurs very close to the next S1.
    - A soft S2 happening just 100-150 ms before a very loud S1 is easily masked by the louder sound. Your ear (and the waveform) simply can't resolve them as separate events; the loud S1 dominates and overshadows the faint S2.
    - **Primary issue is temporal, not intensity**: At 200 bpm, S2's main problem is being **temporally buried** by the adjacent loud S1, not becoming too soft to exist. The acoustic energy of S1 overwhelms the system before S2's waveform can fully resolve.

**Why S2 gets less prominent at higher heart rates:**
-  **Physiologically Soft:** As explained above, S2 is genuinely much quieter due to reduced valve closure force.
- **Masking by S1:** The loud S1 occurring shortly afterward dominates the acoustic energy and visually overshadows the small S2 deflection on the waveform.
- **Temporal Summation:** The sounds are so close together that their waveforms start to overlap, making S2 indistinguishable from the tail end of S1 or the beginning of the next S1.
- **Equipment Limitations:** Recording equipment (microphones, amplifiers, filters) and display settings (gain, time scale) might not be optimized to capture and resolve such a faint, high-frequency sound occurring so close to a much louder one at an extremely rapid rate. S2 often has higher frequency components than S1, which can be harder to record faithfully.

it's also important to note:
- **Normal Heart Rate:** During long diastole, the ventricles fill, pressures equalize, and the mitral valve leaflets float upward, effectively "pre-closing" before the ventricle contracts. The valve only has to close a tiny distance.
- **200 BPM (Short Diastole):** The ventricle is still actively trying to fill when the next contraction starts. The mitral valve leaflets are still fully open due to the rushing blood flow.
- **The Result:** When the ventricle contracts, the valve leaflets have to travel a large distance to slam shut.
This may also be a contributor for why S1 waveform amplitude increases with BPM.

For post Post-Exercise contractility, we can increase the Exponent in this function, decaying over time. 







## Post-Exercise, S1 amplitude remains elevated despite BPM decreasing
> [!ask]
> I'm listening to a audio file and I notice something interesting. This is a recording of the heart during a period exercise and recovery. At rest, the volume of S1 and S2 are very similar, but at higher bpm, S1 is significantly louder than S2. After the workout ends and heart rate decreases but it seems like the contractile force of the heart sill causes S1 to be significantly louder than S2. 
> 
> Then If I compare the audio from 90bpm post workout to 90 bpm before workout, the amplitude difference between S1 and S2 is larger for the heart post workout.

Your observation is the **expected physiology**. This may be called "Inotropic-Chronotropic Dissociation", the heart's rate (speed) and the heart's contractility (force) do not return to baseline at the same time.
The persistence of a relatively loud S1 during early recovery at 90 BPM (compared to pre-exercise 90 BPM) is a real phenomenon caused by **residual sympathetic activation**. This is well-documented in phonocardiography studies.
### Key Mechanisms Explaining Post-Exercise S1 Dominance
#### 1. Sympathetic Tone Persists Beyond Heart Rate Normalization
This is the central mechanism. Beta-adrenergic stimulation affects S1 amplitude more than heart rate:
- **Duration mismatch**: Heart rate recovery begins within 30-60 seconds, but sympathetic neurotransmitter (norepinephrine) clearance and receptor downregulation take **5-10 minutes**
- Contractility remains elevated while Heart Rate is largely controlled by nerve signals (electrical). It can change instantly.
- During recovery, contractility remains augmented while rate falls, creating your observed mismatch
#### 2. The "Cool Down" Effect (Systemic Vascular Resistance)
**Vasodilation diminishes S2:**
- **During/Post-Exercise:** Arteries dilate to supply muscles and release heat. This lowers the resistance in the aorta (Afterload).
- **Impact on S2:** If the arteries are dilated and pressure is lower (which is common immediately post-exercise), the "snap" of the aortic valve is softer.
#### 3. AV Valve Position Remains Altered
From [Merck Manual](http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333/) and [Healio](https://www.healio.com/cardiology/learn-the-heart/cardiology-review/topic-reviews/heart-sounds):
- **Shorter effective PR interval**: Elevated sympathetic tone accelerates AV conduction, keeping mitral/tricuspid leaflets **wider apart** at end-diastole
- **Rapid valve closure**: The leaflets close from a greater distance with more force, increasing S1 intensity
- **Preload effects**: Post-exercise, venous return may still be elevated, affecting diastolic filling dynamics
#### 4. S2 Intensity Fails to "Catch Up"
While S1 remains augmented, S2 normalization lags because:
- **Aortic/pulmonary pressure gradients** recover more slowly as stroke volume remains elevated
- **Residual vasodilation** in skeletal muscle beds affects systemic vascular resistance
- **Splitting patterns** remain abnormal during early recovery

### Code Implementation:
#### Post-Exercise, S1 amplitude remains elevated despite BPM decreasing
**Physiology:** Sympathetic tone persists after HR normalizes → contractility remains elevated → S1 stays loud.
**Code Location:** `bpm_analysis.py`, `_apply_other_pairing_adjustments()`
```python
# Recovery phase detection
if (peak_bpm_time_sec is not None and 
    recovery_end_time_sec is not None and
    peak_bpm_time_sec <= current_time_sec <= recovery_end_time_sec):
    # Override stability floor during recovery
    recovery_floor = params.get("recovery_phase_stability_floor", 0.90)
```
**How it works:**
- When `current_time` is within 120 seconds after peak BPM (your `recovery_phase_duration_sec`), the algorithm knows "I'm in recovery mode."
- This prevents the algorithm from penalizing valid S1-S2 pairs when S2 is re-emerging faintly during early recovery.
**config.py settings:**
```python
"recovery_phase_duration_sec": 120,     # Sympathetic tone persists ~2 minutes
"recovery_phase_stability_floor": 0.90, # Be lenient about faint S2s during this window
```

#### S2 Re-Emergence After Dropout
**Physiology:** After S2 disappears at high BPM, it reappears faintly as HR drops. Initial faint peaks are easy to miss.
**Code Location:** `bpm_analysis.py`, `_kickstart_check()`
```python
# Detect S1→Noise pattern
if matches >= min_matches:
    override_ratio = params.get("kickstart_override_ratio", 0.60)
    logging.info(f"KICK-START: Found {matches} patterns. Overriding pairing ratio to {override_ratio}.")
    self.state['pairing_ratio_override'] = override_ratio
```
**How it works:**
- If last 4 beats show pattern: **S1 (Lone) → Noise → S1 (Lone) → Noise**, it means S2 is trying to reappear but being rejected as noise.
- Algorithm **temporarily boosts pairing_ratio to 0.60**, giving faint S2 peaks a chance to be paired.
- This is your "get out of Lone S1 mode" mechanism.
**config.py settings:**
```python
"kickstart_check_threshold": 0.3,           # Only run when pairing_ratio is low
"kickstart_override_ratio": 0.60,           # Temporarily accept more pairs
```

#### Contractility vs. Rate Mismatch (Post-Exercise 90 BPM)
**Physiology:** At 90 BPM post-exercise, contractility is still high (loud S1). At 90 BPM pre-exercise, contractility is normal (balanced S1/S2).
**Code Location:** `bpm_analysis.py`, `PeakClassifier.__init__`
```python
# State initialization uses start_bpm_hint
self.state['long_term_bpm'] = float(start_bpm_hint) if start_bpm_hint else 80.0
self.state['long_term_bpm_history'] = []
```
**How it works:**
- The **entire algorithm's expectation** is anchored to `long_term_bpm`, not instantaneous rate.
- After peak exertion at 170 BPM, `long_term_bpm` slowly decays (learning rate 0.05). At 90 BPM post-exercise, `long_term_bpm` might still be 110-120.
- The contractility model (Section 1 above) uses this **higher belief BPM** → expects S1 dominance → doesn't penalize loud S1 at 90 BPM.
**Example timeline:**
1. Peak: 170 BPM → `long_term_bpm = 170`
2. 1 min later: Instant BPM = 90, but `long_term_bpm` ≈ 120 (slow decay)
3. Algorithm still in "high contractility" mode → expects S1 > S2 → correctly processes post-exercise audio
#### S1 Amplitude Floor (Preventing Noise as S1)
**Physiology:** Even at high BPM, S1 must exceed a minimum amplitude to be a real heartbeat.
**Code Location:** `bpm_analysis.py`, `_validate_lone_s1()`
```python
# Absolute prominence guardrail
if len(recent_prominences) >= 5:
    reference_prominence = np.percentile(recent_prominences, 80)
    if prominence_ratio < params['lone_s1_min_prominence_ratio']:  # Default 0.4
        penalty_factor = float(np.clip(prominence_ratio / 0.4, 0.0, 1.0))
        confidence *= penalty_factor
```
**How it works:**
- Tracks top 20% of recent S1 prominences as reference
- Current S1 must be >40% of reference amplitude, or confidence is slashed
- Prevents noise spikes from being mistaken for S1, even if timing is plausible


## S2 disappears and reappears in some recordings
**Problem:**
In some recordings, when bpm increases, S1 becomes so much louder that S2 is not longer audible in the recording at all. 
When bpm decreases again post exertion, S2 becomes visible again

The mechanism behind this is unclear, but it's a reoccurring trend in my dataset. 
It must be the recording mythology used to capture the data or the position of the stethoscope during exercise etc. 

right now, the pairing history shows 0% pairs made after bpm starts to decrease which is true, but this also causes the current stability adjust logic to tank the confidence making it unlikely to pair S1-S2 afterwards.
Kick-Start Recovery Mechanism feels like a band aid fix to this issue. A more robust solution should be used instead

### Kick-Start Recovery Mechanism
**Problem:** When paring ratio reaches, 0 it's very difficult to begin paring again since lack of pairing decreases pairing ratio. This is a negative feedback loop. 
During recovery, S2 disappears. The algorithm enters a "Lone S1 only" mode and can't exit even when S2 reappears.
**Solution:** Scan last 4 beats. If pattern is S1→Noise repeated 3+ times, temporarily boost pairing ratio to 0.60.
**Why this works:** S2 re-emerges as faint peaks that fail normal confidence thresholds. Kick-start gives them a chance to anchor the rhythm again.
**Code:** `_kickstart_check()`, `kickstart_override_ratio`




## Explanation of prominence calculation
### Peak Prominence Calculation
**Purpose:** Prominence measures how much a peak stands above its local background, making it robust against global volume changes and temporary noise.
Initially, I only compared peaks by their amplitudes but background noise (the noise floor) needed to be accounted for. 
When noise inflates trough heights, prominence will decrease.

**How it's calculated:**
1. **Find adjacent troughs:** For a given peak at index `i`, locate the nearest trough to the left (`i-1`) and right (`i+1`) using the pre-computed `trough_indices`.
2. **Determine key col:** The key col is the **higher** of the two trough amplitudes (the "shoulder" of the peak).
3. **Calculate prominence:** `prominence = peak_amplitude - key_col_amplitude`

**Code:** `get_peak_prominence_details()` in `bpm_analysis.py`
**parameters In `config.py`:**
```python
    "trough_prominence_quantile": 0.1,   # How much a dip must stand out to be considered a 'trough'.
    "trough_rejection_multiplier": 10.0,    # A trough N-times higher than the draft noise floor is rejected.
```

### Trough Sanitization
**Problem:** Temporary noise creates high troughs that inflate the noise floor, reducing prominence of valid peaks that occur after noise ends.
*Temporary noise deviates from the noise floor:*
[![|756x182](https://i.imgur.com/iDTD90X.jpeg)
This specific scenario shown above also creates two "Trapezoid Artifacts" since S1 S2 labeling swaps twice resulting in the correct labeling after. I guess two wrongs do make a right...

**Solution:** During noise floor calculation, reject troughs that exceed 10x the draft floor value. This keeps loud transient noise from affecting the calculated prominence of our peaks during a brief moment of noise. 
**Limitation:** Does not handle noise that occurs between S1 and S2 peaks during the pairing phase.


### Important to note
It's important to note that prominence is calculated against the troughs adjacent to the current peak and not against the noise floor.

> [!think]
> Is it a good idea to have it implemented in this way? I find it a bit questionable but I have no proof that it causes any issues so I'll leave a developer's note here



## HRV calculation
**[Lomb–Scargle periodogram](https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/lomb/lomb.html)** for HRV calculation to obtain frequency-domain data such as VLF, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio
- FFT assumes evenly spaced samples, R–R (beat-to-beat) data is inherently uneven. 
- (SDNN/RMSSD is time domain data)
- Caveats:
	- Shorter segments: frequency-domain measures become less reliable; minimum lengths in the literature are often ~4–5 minutes for stable VLF/LF/HF; HF can still be usable down to ~10 s; LF is more reliable with at least ~30–60 s.


## Trapezoid Artifacts
### Trapezoid Artifact Detection
**Problem:** A single noise peak causes S1/S2 swap, then another noise swap flips them back. BPM graph shows characteristic "notch."
**This is what It looks like:**
https://github.com/WolfExplode/bpm_analysis/blob/main/Examples/R18%E5%BF%83%E9%9F%B31_bpm_plot.html
![|716x195](https://imgur.com/sIfPq8w.jpg)
![|716x195](https://imgur.com/b7TKFmS.jpg)
**It is caused by these failure modes:**
trapezoid artifact #1
![|422x267](https://imgur.com/jRHjahH.jpg)
trapezoid artifact #2
![|422x246](https://imgur.com/jTFakMB.jpg)
In this case, this file contains two Trapezoid Artifacts. the first one was caused by some noise or PVC during a period where S1 and S2 prominence is similar.
This causes the labeling of S1 and S2 to switch until S1 and S2 prominence deviates enough for the algorithm to correct the mistake resulting in the second trapezoid artifact.
the second trapezoid artifact is caused by peaks labeled LoneS1 followed by S1.

**Solution:**
📌The solution of this issue is only half implemented. I only implemented a way to identify trapezoid artifacts but not a way to use them to make the script more robust

The human eye can easily identify errors in the BPM/time graph so I implemented a function to allow the script to identify them automatically.
Detects trapezoid-shaped discontinuities in the average BPM series that are characteristic of a brief extra-beat artifact:
  - A very fast rise
  - A sustained plateau
  - A very fast fall that returns to baseline
**Code:** `detect_trapezoid_discontinuities()`


## Parameter Tuning Rationale
Parameters in `config.py` were hand-tuned across multiple PCG recordings from consumer hardware.
A known limitation: tightening a parameter to reduce errors on one file can increase errors on another.
This is partly unavoidable given how much recording conditions vary (microphone position, movement noise, BPM range).
If you find yourself re-tuning frequently, the underlying algorithm is probably not robust enough for that class of recording -- see the "Known Limitations" section.

### Noise Floor Parameters
- `trough_rejection_multiplier=4.0`: Reject troughs >4x draft floor. Calibrated to keep physiological troughs while rejecting movement artifacts.
- `noise_window_sec=4`: Rolling window for noise floor. Long enough to smooth out temporary noise, short enough to track gradual changes in background noise.
### Confidence Thresholds
- `pairing_confidence_threshold=0.55`: Empirically determined. Lower values increase false pairs; higher values miss faint S2s.
- `lone_s1_confidence_threshold=0.50`: Must be strong enough to avoid noise, but lenient enough to catch valid single beats when S2 is absent.
### Lookahead Parameters
- `noise_prominence_threshold=0.35`: Middle peak must be <35% of S1 prominence to be considered skippable. Prevents skipping valid S2s.
- `enable_lookahead_skipping=True`: Master switch because lookahead is aggressive. Can be disabled for clean recordings.



## Known Limitations & Edge Cases

### Sequential Decision Making
Currently, peak labeling is assigned locally and greedily as each peak is classified based on immediate context.
**The problem**: A local decision can force suboptimal future choices. If you label a weak peak as S1, you may miss a stronger S1-S2 pair just milliseconds later.
The majority of the issues in our algorithm come from sequential decision making. If only there was a way to give our code a more holistic view.

### Cold Start Problem
The cold start is a consequence of sequential decision making
**Issue:** First 4 seconds often misclassified because long_term_bpm hasn't stabilized. 
**Workaround:** Provide `start_bpm_hint` when possible. The `_kickstart_check` helps but isn't perfect.


**Example of Failure mode:**
![|968x178](https://imgur.com/6BK2wQk.jpg)
![|968x190](https://imgur.com/XEYt7r4.jpg)
In this case, the very first peak was mislabeled as Lone S1 while it was S2. Since this is the first peak of the recording, it's impossible to determine if it's S1 or S2 without scanning backwards and using future knowledge

> [!think]
> we could scan backwards to fix errors that occurred before.
> This is difficult to implement because our algorithm expects forward data. Reversing the logic is a non trivial task.

> [!think]
> What if we just loop the waveform back onto itself and run it continuously?
> Then there would be no start... we just process the start data and then discard it after running it again. Therefore there will be no initial labeling in the final output. 
> 
> But what if the start bpm is 60 and the end bpm is 180? What if the audio ends on S2 and starts on S2? this seems like a bad idea









### Noisy audio
There's no real way to solve this issue... just don't input noisy audio I guess

### Heartbeat audio with Arrhythmia/PVCs
**Issue:** This software isn't built to detect PVCs or Arrhythmia
**Future idea:** I plan to support this in the future but I haven't come up with a idea yet

### S1/S2 Swapping During Breathing
**Issue:** During inhalation, S1-S2 amplitude difference decreases. Can cause temporary S2→S1 misclassification, especially if timing aligns poorly.
**Current mitigation:** Contractility model helps but doesn't fully solve it. The `penalty_waiver` logic for ideal deviation range catches some cases.
**Future idea:** Track a rolling history of S1-S2 deviation. If deviation suddenly drops without BPM increase, suspect breathing inversion rather than true contractility change.






### Missing S2 in High BPM
**Issue:** Above ~180 BPM, S2 may be physically absent from waveform due to temporal merging with next S1.
**Current solution:** Algorithm gracefully degrades to Lone S1 mode when pairing fails consistently.
**Future:** Could add a "S2 dropout detection" that disables pairing entirely when consecutive Lone S1s exceed threshold at high BPM.



## Optimizations:
60% of the script's runtime is conversion time, which is fundamentally unavoidable because it's dominated by FFmpeg decoding the compressed MP4 audio stream
Attempting to optimize the remaining 40% of our script's runtime seems kinda silly in comparison...
**Decode time dominates because:**
- MP4 audio is compressed with complex psychoacoustic models (AAC=O(n²) decode)
- 18 minutes of 44.1kHz stereo AAC = ~120 MB → ~1.9 GB PCM
- FFmpeg must decode every frame sequentially




## Notes about the current state of my codebase
Let's do a **Codebase audit**

So far, our code has
**Technical debt**: 
If I can find a better solution these band aid fixes would not be here: (e.g., "kick-start" recovery mechanisms, cascade resets)

**Architectural Debt:**
- **Deep call stacks**: 6-stage pipeline with shared state dictionaries makes debugging challenging

**Undocumented code**
Documentation should be reserved for reasoning and not the specific details on how the idea is implemented. This keeps our documentation flexible to massive algorithm changes with no changes in documentation

### Other remarks
The code has several issues that don't fundamentally change the bpm estimation:
- There might be recordings where the stethoscope is removed resulting in no heartbeats at all, do we have a case for this?
	- Well, if the user of this tool inputs garbage then they should get garbage out. Not my fault and not my problem to fix. User error.

### The S1-S2 interval changes post exertion
I'm listening to another audio file and I make another observation. This is a recording the heart during a period exertion and recovery

The S1-S2 interval is the time between S1 and S2, Systolic Time Interval (STI). This should logically decrease as heart rate increases. 
From what we know about Heart Rate Kinetics, contractility remains elevated post exertion despite a drop in heart rate. We previously spoke about this but we never considered the impact of exertion on the temporal aspect, the  S1-S2 interval. 

I've noticed that after exercise, the S1-S2 interval rapidly decreases and stays low. The S1-S2 interval is much lower for the same bpm than compared to before exertion. 
For example, before exertion, the S1_S2_interval was ~0.195s but after exertion, the S1_S2_interval decreased to between 0.145s and 0.160s. 

The **S1-S2 interval** represents **systolic ejection time**, the period from mitral/tricuspid valve closure (S1) to aortic/pulmonary valve closure (S2). This interval is determined by:
1. **Contractility** (how forcefully the ventricle contracts)
2. **Afterload** (pressure the ventricle pumps against)
3. **Preload** (ventricular filling volume)
4. **Heart rate** (via force-frequency relationship)

**This is caused by both increased cardiac contractility and reduced afterload.**
Residual adrenaline increases the rate of calcium cycling within the cells which causes the muscle to contract faster. This "lag" exists because the electrical pacemaker (SA Node) recovers faster than the chemical removal of adrenaline from the blood.
Post-exercise vasodilation in skeletal muscle beds decreases systemic vascular resistance. This reduces afterload (decreased aortic pressure during ejection). This allows for a faster, shorter ejection. 

In clinical cardiology, this specific measurement (shortening of the QS2 interval or LVET) is sometimes used as a sensitive marker for "adrenergic drive." QS2 Index is often used in stress testing for this purpose. 

> [!think]
> With precise timing data, we can calculate the S1-S2 / Cycle Length ratio (the Duty Cycle of the heart). This would show what percentage of time the heart spends "working" vs "resting" at that specific post-workout moment.

### Split S2 
Split S2 visible in the Hilbert transform waveform envelope:
![|1018x182](https://imgur.com/dm8zzsY.jpg)

There should be a way to detect split S2. I'm thinking, After S1 and S2 peaks are labeled, we can go back and find more peaks.
Around the timeframe where S2 peaks are labeled, we should disable or drasticly reduce the min_peak_distance_sec and rescan. Maybe we can pick up the two split peaks.
I think the rescan for new peaks should be at the very end, after the post processing peak labeling stuff etc. because it depends on the labelings for the S2 peaks.

> [!think]
> If we can find a way to identify areas of Split S2, we might be able to calculate RSA from this data.

I'm not sure how to store split S2 in the code. I plan on doing respiratory rate Analysis with split S2 data.
In some files with low noise and a prominent S2 peak(s), it's easy to identify a split S2 but in some audios, split S2 may not be so easy to identify. In those cases, we will pick up many peaks around the S2 area. what shall we do? 











### Breathing:

#### How Heavy Breathing Modifies Heart Sounds
**During Inspiration:**
- Increased venous return causes right ventricular preload to increase
- RV stroke volume increases causes pulmonary flow to increase
- S2 splitting widens (P2 delayed)
- S1 may soften slightly as increased lung volume dampens transmission
	- [ ] Is this observed in our dataset? 
**During Expiration:**
- Decreased venous return results in a drop in RV preload
- S2 becomes single (A2-P2 fuse)
- Heart shifts position to be closer to chest wall, potentially amplifying sounds
	- [ ] is this observed in our dataset?

But only sometimes...
It's rare, but respiratory rate can be calculated at some times, it's difficult though, because a person might stop breathing, hold their breath momentarily, or just some random noise in the waveform.
This is a difficult challenge because sometimes the data is extremely clear and easy to parse. other times it's non existent. 


#### Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

Heart rate increases during inspiration
Heart rate decreases during expiration
- [ ] Is this observed in our dataset? 

Breathing, Lung sounds (bronchial airflow) should create high-frequency noise (100-1000 Hz)
- [ ] Is this observed in our dataset? 





#### unimplemented
I want a way to identify breathing from the audio

graph the temporary noise by taking the troughs and comparing to the noise floor. then graphing that value
the idea is, temporary noise might be from breathing so by doing this, we might be able to visualize breathing. 
What if we do a different EQ filter on the initial audio to scan for breathing sounds instead?


Normal breathing causes physiological splitting of S2, can we use this to our advantage?
first, we need to be able to determine if our dataset contains this phenomenon 

#### unimplemented
Let's brainstorm based on some patterns that we can observe from the data. Take a look at how S1 is substantially louder than S2, but then there is some temporary noise that's spread out. When the noise increases, S1 amplitude decreases. 
we can also observe the inverse for S2. when noise increases S2 increases as well. At first I thought this was because the amplitude of S2 was "riding on top of" the noise but since S1 was decreasing this doesn't make sense.

Then I realized the noise must be from breathing since it's gradual fade in and out. 
Let's try to understand the heart's function and how the audio is being recorded. S1 must be decreasing since the stethoscope is further away from the chest at that time. but then why does S2 increase instead? the `trough-S2-trough` distance increases during breathing?
Is this normal physiology?

**Positional Shift:** As the diaphragm descends, the heart itself shifts slightly in the chest cavity. It can rotate or move downwards, changing its orientation relative to the fixed position of the stethoscope.
The heart's rotation might simultaneously move the pulmonic valve closer or into a better acoustic alignment with the stethoscope.

By looking at the noise floor and toughs, we can clearly see the affect of breathing in the waveform:

### Modeling Heart contractility
Regarding The idea of contractile force, what if we could display how hard the heart contracts by examining the amplitude deviation between S1 and S2 and mapping a trend.

Nah but that depends on how the audio is recorded. just because S1 is louder than S2 in this recording, doesn't specifically mean that the heart is contracting strongly. 
but there must be a positive correlation with total audio amplitude and contractile force. obviously heart contractility correlates with bpm, but my idea is to further identify when the contractility of the heart is seemingly misaligned with bpm. Such as Post-Exercise S1 Dominance as documented previously. 

I've added `Average S1 contractility`, `Average S2 contractility` , and `Average contractility` traces to the plot. They just take the location of the S1 peaks etc, to make a graph. I averaged over time to give it a bit of smoothing. 
The idea is to visualize how contractility (S1/S2 prominence) changes as BPM increases or decreases over the recording (e.g. exercise and recovery). This allows us to observe how S1 contractility remains high after exercise despite BPM decreasing. 
Contractility can also be used to visualize RSA.

> Right now, the too close warning is based on the grouping logic, but since there's only going to be one group now, the warning pops up for sections where the bpm is just fast.
