- Results are cached for faster access
- Large files may take several minutes

### Browser Compatibility
- Works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- JavaScript required for upload progress and interactive features

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port 8000 busy**: Use `python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001`
2. **Import errors**: Run `pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt`
3. **File upload fails**: Check file size (max 100MB) and format
4. **Analysis errors**: Ensure audio contains clear heartbeat sounds

### Debug Mode
Django debug is enabled - you'll see detailed error messages if something goes wrong.
